# Solito

A Solito project is typically two separate applications that share a monorepo (typically an Expo and a Next.js application)

You will need to setup each project individually. We recommend using the [Babel Plugin](../guides/babel) for your native app and [Next.js via Babel](./nextjs) for your Next.js app.

You can also spin up a [Solito](http://solito.dev) project with the setup already done:

```bash
npx create-solito-app@latest my-solito-app -t with-tailwind
```

Head over to the [Solito Tailwind CSS Starter](https://solito.dev/tailwind) docs for more information.
