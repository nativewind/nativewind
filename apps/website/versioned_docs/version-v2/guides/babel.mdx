# Babel

The default babel configuration will both compile the Tailwind CSS styles and transform any component with the `className` attributed into a `styled` version.

This is the recommended configuration as it provides the fastest setup and best DX experience, with zero configuration needed for Tailwind Intellisense within your IDE.

## Setup

### 1. Install the dependencies

<Dependencies />

### 2. Setup Tailwindcss

<Tailwind />

### 3. Configure your babel.config.js

```js
// babel.config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: ["nativewind/babel"],
};
```

<StartCoding />

## Configuring what is transformed

When targeting `Web` you may be using components that should not be transformed.

By default native components (e.g. `div`) are not transformed.

However if you are using a `web` only library such as `react-select`, you can disabled the transform on components imported from this library.

Either by explicitly stating which modules can be transformed.

```diff
// babel.config.js
module.exports = {
- plugins: ["nativewind/babel"],
+ plugins: [
+   [
+    "nativewind/babel"
+    { allowModuleTransform: ["moti"] }
+   ]
+ ],
};
```

Or blocking modules you don't want transformed.

```diff
// babel.config.js
module.exports = {
- plugins: ["nativewind/babel"],
+ plugins: [
+   [
+    "nativewind/babel"
+    { blockModuleTransform: ["react-select"] }
+   ]
+ ],
};
```
