# Benchmarks

:::caution

This page is still under development, please do not use this data to reach any conclusions.

:::

These are micro benchmarks and should not be used to formulate opinions on real-world scenarios. They only demonstrate how NativeWind performs under controlled scenarios. The benchmarks are run via GitHub Actions which is not a stable environment and greatly increases the variance.

The benchmarks are [open-source](https://github.com/marklawlor/nativewind/tree/next/apps/benchmarks) and we highly encourage you fork them and test in a stable environment.
