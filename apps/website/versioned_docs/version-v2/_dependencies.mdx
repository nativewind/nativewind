You will need to install both `nativewind` and `tailwindcss`

`tailwindcss` is not used during runtime so it can be added as a development dependency.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM" default>

```
npm install nativewind
npm install --save-dev tailwindcss@3.3.2
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">

```
yarn add nativewind
yarn add --dev tailwindcss@3.3.2
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


:::caution

NativeWind does not work with TailwindCSS >3.3.2. If you wish to use the most current version, please upgrade to [NativeWind v4](/overview)
