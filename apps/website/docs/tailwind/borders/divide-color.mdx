:::note divideOpacity (native only)

For performance reasons, NativeWind renders with the `corePlugin` `divideOpacity` disabled. This plugin allows the divide color to dynamically change its opacity via the `--tw-divide-opacity` variable. Instead, the opacity is set as a static value in the `color` property.

If you need to use this feature, you can enable it by adding the following to your `tailwind.config.js` file:

```js title=tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  /* ...  */
  corePlugin: {
    divideOpacity: true,
  },
};
```
