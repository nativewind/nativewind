You will need to install `nativewind` and its peer dependencies `tailwindcss`, `react-native-reanimated` and `react-native-safe-area-context`.

<NPM
  framework={props.framework}
  deps={[
    "nativewind",
    "tailwindcss@^3.4.17",
    props.framework === 'framework-less' ? 'react-native-reanimated' : 'react-native-reanimated@3.16.2',
    "react-native-safe-area-context",
  ]}
/>
