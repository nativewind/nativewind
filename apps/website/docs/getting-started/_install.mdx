You will need to install `nativewind` and its peer dependencies `tailwindcss`, `react-native-reanimated` and `react-native-safe-area-context`.

<NPM
  deps={[
    "nativewind",
    "tailwindcss",
    "react-native-reanimated",
    "react-native-safe-area-context",
  ]}
/>

**Non-Expo projects**

Run `pod-install` to finish installation of `react-native-reanimated`.

```bash
npx pod-install
```
