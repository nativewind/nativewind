# About

Do you like using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) to style your apps? This helps you do that in [React Native](https://reactnative.dev). NativeWind is **not** a component library, it's a styling library. If you're looking for component libraries that support NativeWind, [see below](https://github.com/nativewind/nativewind/tree/%40danstepanov/docs-v4.1?tab=readme-ov-file#what-if-im-looking-for-a-component-library-that-uses-nativewind).

NativeWind makes sure you're using the best style engine for any given platform (e.g. CSS StyleSheet or StyleSheet.create). It's goals are to to provide a consistent styling experience across all platforms, improving developer UX, component performance, and code maintainability.

NativeWind processes your styles during your application's build step and uses a minimal runtime to selectively apply reactive styles (eg changes to device orientation, light dark mode).

## Installation

If you have an existing project, [use these guides](https://www.nativewind.dev/v4/getting-started/react-native) to configure NativeWind for your respective stack.

Alternatively, you can create a new pre-configured project via our Quickstart options, below.

## Quickstart

You can get started with any of the following options:

- [Create Expo Stack](https://rn.new): `npx create-expo-stack@latest --nativewind`
- ~~[Create Expo App](https://expo.new): `npx create-expo-app -e with-nativewind`~~ (being fixed to work with v4)

## Features

- Works on **all** RN platforms, uses the best style system for each platform.
- Uses the Tailwind CSS compiler
- Styles are computed at **build time**
- Small runtime keeps your components fast
- **jsxImportSourceTransform** only wraps native components, making it lighter and such that the **className** prop is accessible inside your component
- Respects all tailwind.config.js settings, including **themes, custom values,** and **plugins**
- Support for
  - custom CSS properties, aka **CSS Variables**
  - **dark mode, arbitrary classes,** and **media queries**
  - **animations** and **transitions**
  - **container queries**
    - `container-type` and style-based container queries are not supported
  - pseudo classes - **hover / focus / active** on compatible components
  - `rem` units
  - theme functions and nested functions
  - React 18 Suspense API
  - Custom CSS
- Styling based on **parent state modifiers** - automatically style children based upon parent pseudo classes
  - support for the `group` and `group/<name>` syntax
- **Children styles** - create simple layouts based upon parent class
- Fast and consistent style application via hot reload
  - includes changes made to `tailwind.config.js`

# FAQ

## Is NativeWind moving to Expo?

No. Expo is always exploring ways to handle styles better but NativeWind, as a project, will not be moving into the Expo organization.

## What happened to v3?

Similar to Valve, we don't like the number 3. Nah, we had a V3 but it was a bad idea and needed to be reworked so we dropped it and moved on to v4.

## What if I'm looking for a component library that uses NativeWind?

There are a number of different component libraries available that use NativeWind to achieve different results. You should pick the one that best suits your needs.

### [NativeWindUI](https://nativewindui.com)

This multi-platform library focuses on achieving native feel for each individual platform using the familiar interface of Tailwind CSS.

### [React Native Reusables](https://rnr-docs.vercel.app)

This open source library offers universal [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) via React Native. Use this as a foundation to develop your own high-quality component library.

### [GluestackUI v2](https://gluestack.io)

From the folks that brought you NativeBase, this library offers customizable cross-platform components designed to look & behave cleanly on every platform.
